**Project Documentation: Portfolio Website**

This project is my Portfolio Website that showcases my projects and work. It was built with React. My website features a responsive design and allows users to filter and view different projects that I created.

**Technologies Used:**

1. React: The website is built using React, which provides a component-based architecture for building user interfaces.
2. React Icons: The project uses React Icons to include icons in the user interface, such as the information circle icon.
3. JavaScript: JavaScript is used for implementing functionality and interactivity within the website.
4. HTML/CSS: The project utilizes HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling the user interface.

**Project Structure:**

1. **HeaderContent Component:** The HeaderContent component is responsible for rendering the header text of the portfolio section. It receives the header text as a prop and displays it within an h2 element.

2. **Portfolio Component:** The Portfolio component is the main component of the website. It renders the portfolio section, including the project cards and filter options. It utilizes state management with React's useState hook to handle filtering and hovering functionality. The component also makes use of the portfolioData and filterData arrays to display project information and filter options.

3. **Styling:** The project includes a separate SCSS file for styling the portfolio section. The SCSS file contains styles for the portfolio content, filter options, project cards, and hover effects.

**Usage:**
Users can visit the portfolio website to view the developer's projects. They can filter projects based on categories such as "All," "Development," and "Design." Each project card displays an image, and users can click the "Visit" button to open the project's link in a new tab.

**Future Enhancements:**
Potential future enhancements for the project could include adding more projects to the portfolioData array, implementing animations for project cards, and integrating a contact form or additional sections to the website.

Overall, the portfolio website provides a clean and interactive way for the developer to showcase their work and projects to potential clients or employers.
